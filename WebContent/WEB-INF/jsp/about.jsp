InspirationWorld.Com has been started by a person who has started the journey to help people spiritually.
Our team is quite unique in the way we combine our experience as a true spiritual persons with many years of practice of an authentic system of meditation.
In addition to this practical business and spiritual experience we each have an average of over 15 years experience 
practicing and teaching meditation, working closely as colleagues with one another and sharing the inevitable ups and downs in our working lives and on our personal journeys. 
We think this places us extremely well to respond to whatever your personal, professional or organizational questions are with a combination of concrete and practical expertise and some radical, insightful and provocative ways to think differently about work and organizational life.

As a team we share a commitment to helping others find ways to place wisdom and compassion at the heart of their working lives.
